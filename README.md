## Course: Cyber Data Anlytics

The goal of the course is to find malicious acts or vulnerabilities in data. For this course there are three labs.

### Lab 1: Class imbalance
Detecting malicious or fraudulent data records in payment transactions. 
- Goal: How to deal with large class imbalances in machine learning.

### Lab 2: Anomaly detection in SCADA systems
Applying techniques for anomaly detection in SCADA systems. Anomaly detection is typically harder than classification because the data are unlabeled. We have to rely on statistics such as occurrence counts or value ranges to find anomalies, rendering many machine learning methods inapplicable. Securing SCADA system is considered one of the most important problems in cyber security. 
- Goal: Detect anomalies in continuous and discrete sequential data, detect anomalies in multivariate signal data and evaluate the performance.

### Lab 3: Data streams
Applying techniques to build approximations of a large network data streams on-the-fly and evaluate the quality of the obtained approximations. In addition, applying fingerprinting/profiling to the problem of botnet detection in computer networks and compare it with flow classification.
- Goal: Use sampling and hashing to create correct approximations of large data streams. Build methods for fingerprinting and profiling behaviours. Detect botnets in network data.
